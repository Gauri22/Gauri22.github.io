    <h2 style="position: absolute;top: 13%;left: 4%;color: navy;">1.The wingtreOne PPK VTOL-</h2>
    <p style="position: absolute;top: 19%;left: 4%;color: black;font-size: 23px;">The WingtraOne PPK VTOL is a fixed-wing, fully autonomous drone that has been <br> specifically designed to cover long distances. It allows for a flight pre-plan due to its <br> intelligent WingtraPilot software. The WingtraOne can automatically capture surveying <br> data at the touch of a button. The WingtraOne also has the impressive ability to set off <br> vertically like a quadcopter, even on difficult terrain removing the need to launch or <br> catapult the aircraft.It’s capable of flying for up to 55 minutes and has been designed <br> to cover long distances.

    <p style="position: absolute;top: 59%;left: 4%;color: black;font-size: 23px;">Parrot was an early pioneer of intelligent multirotor drones.  The Parrot AR drone <br> might seems positively primitive now, but at the time it was an amazing feat of <br> consumer technology.The deal is made even sweeter with the inclusion of FPV gogg- <br> les, but you do need a smartphone to act as the screen. The Parrot Skycontroller 2 does <br> duty as the transmitter and gives you a  1.2 mile rangeThat might sound like plenty, but <br> given that  the Disco will reach a whopping 50 mph , it could be out of range in less than <br> a minute if you floor it.Camera duties are performed by a  14 megapixel 1080p camera <br> with a wide-angle lens .To top it off, it’s rated for  45 minutes of flight time.
