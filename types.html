        <h1 style="position: absolute;left: 4%;color: black;text-decoration: underline;">Diffrent parts of Drone.</h1>
    </a>
    <h2 style="position: absolute;top: 9%;left: 4%;color: navy;font-family: sans-serif;">Flight Controller:</h2>
    <h4 style="position: absolute;top: 13%;left: 4%;color: #0009;font-family: sans-serif;">You can consider this component as the brain of the drone. So, how the drone is going to work depends on this part mainly. There are different kinds of flight controllers available with the various sorts of applications with it. In fact, you can find
        out numerous applications with such flight controllers like Pixhawk. You can take into consideration the central flight controllers as well as Naze. Those are mainly used in small size quadcopters. So when you are thinking of high performance
        of the drone, then flight controller will be the most important component to ensure the same.</h4>
    <h2 style="position: absolute;top: 47%;left: 4%;color: navy;font-family: sans-serif;">Motors:</h2>
    <h4 style="position: absolute;top: 51%;left: 4%;color: #0009;font-family: sans-serif;">To run the drone the force from behind is required. The number of motors attached to the machine will provide it. Some of the drones have four motors. You will find drones with six or eight motors as well. You can use some motors as well inside the
        drone. If the number of motors is four inside the drone, it is told a quadcopter. In the case of six motors, it will be called a hexacopter. It will be a very crucial thing to find out the best motors for your drone because it will ensure the
        best performance of the drone as well.</h4>
    <h2 style="position: absolute;top: 82%;left: 4%;color: navy;font-family: sans-serif;">Propellers:</h2>
    <h4 style="position: absolute;top: 86%;left: 4%;color: #0009;font-family: sans-serif;">After motors propellers, it can also be considered as one of the most important components for a drone. There are two kinds of propellers. One is two blade propellers that are traditional. Now, you can also find three blade propellers, which have
        come on the market recently, and they are providing better performance for the drone. The propeller will be of different sizes. Now, the size of the propeller should be with the proportionate of the size of the drone. So, you need to buy the propeller
        of the particular size, which will go fine with the size of the drone. So, what motor and propeller you will purchase for the drone is interred related.</h4>
    <h2 style="position: absolute;top: 123%;left: 4%;color: navy;font-family: sans-serif;">Speed controllers:</h2>
    <h4 style="position: absolute;top: 127%;left: 4%;color: #0009;font-family: sans-serif;">There are lots of rules and regulations regarding the speed of the drones in different countries. This is why the speed controller of a drone will surely be one of the most important components of a drone. If you want to know about the anatomy of
        a drone then having the knowledge about eh speed controller will be very much important. This speed controller is an electronic device, which controls the speed of the motor inside the drone. It will receive the command from the flight controller
        and then it will convey the same to the motors. Accordingly, the motor will provide that amount of force to the drone. The size of the speed controller will also depend on the size of the drone. So, when you are deciding to purchase a speed controller,
        you should keep the size of the drone in consideration.</h4>
    <h2 style="position: absolute;top: 172%;left: 4%;color: navy;font-family: sans-serif;">Gimbal and the Camera:</h2>
    <h4 style="position: absolute;top: 176%;left: 4%;color: #0009;font-family: sans-serif;">The purpose of using a drone completes when you can add the camera to the same with the help of the Gimbal. It is true that this component will not have any effect on the basic function of a drone. However, if you are not having a camera attached
        to the drone the purpose of using a drone will not be fulfilled. The cameras will send the real-time pictures to the controller of the drone. When it comes to the camera attached to a drone, it is considered to be a small size camera that can
        capture pictures and footage as per the necessity. A Gimbal is required to stabilize the camera in the drone so that it can take the pictures and the footage smoothly. You will be able to find out some of the drones that have a camera but no Gimbal.
        However, if you are searching for the aerial photographs from the drone, then the presence of the Gimbal along with the camera will be extremely essential. The use of normal size camera is little rare in the case of drones because those will be
        little heavier than expected. So, you will see the use of the FPV cameras with the drones, which are smaller in size.</h4>
    <h2 style="position: absolute;top: 237%;left: 4%;color: navy;font-family: sans-serif;">Battery:</h2>
    <h4 style="position: absolute;top: 241%;left: 4%;color: #0009;font-family: sans-serif;">The battery can be considered as a very crucial part of the drone because from the battery only the drone will get the required energy to fly at a particular time. In the case of drone, you will see the use of the heavy-duty batteries, which are manufactured
        with the assistance of lithium polymer. There are some of the other materials also with which such batteries are made. A good quality battery will provide your drone a fly time of twenty minutes normally. However, you can find out different batteries
        for the drones. So, which battery you will choose for the drone is up to your choice only. There are some of the other crucial things that you have to keep in consideration as well when you are thinking of drone parts.</h4>
