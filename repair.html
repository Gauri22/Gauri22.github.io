    <h1 style="position: absolute;top: 65%;left: 4%;">You Crashed your drone and now it needs repair, Now What?</h1>
    <p style="position: absolute;top: 82%;left: 4%;font-size: 22px;line-height: 27px;">Drones are made of sensitive parts that get easily damaged with small fall like from your desk or unable to track the obstacles during he flight. Sometimes despite the obstacle avoidance sensor, the drone fails to detect them and gets crashed. Drone
        repair is possible when drone has warranty or when the part is easily available. When your drone does not come with a warranty or when the warranty runs out, you may get it insured as a safety measure. The insurance helps in recovering a lot of
        costs incurred during the drone repair. Your drone may get damaged due to the following assumed reasons; Waterlogged, Falling from the sky, Crash during sudden fail in battery, Smashed, Lack of obstacle avoidance sensors or an-assumed crash while
        carrying them. The drone may get damaged anytime and anywhere without the knowledge of the user. Since it is a sensitive little insect, there are chances that a little mishandling may result in great loss.

    <h1 style="position: absolute;top: 169%;left: 4%;">How to find a drone repair shop near me?</h1>
    <p style="position: absolute;top: 180%;left: 4%;font-size: 20px;line-height: 26px;">When you have crashed your drone, be it the DJI manufactured drone or any other brand, you have to find quick solutions ASAP. Here, assuming that you own a DJI drone, then there are hundreds of registered repair shops worldwide. All you have to do

        center, tell them everything about the damages. Follow the below points wisely to get the drone repair done easily at a lowest possible price.
    </p>
    <h3 style="position: absolute;top: 232%;left: 4%;"><span>*Don't lie</span></h3>
    <p style="position: absolute;top: 236%;left: 4%;font-size: 20px;line-height: 26px;">It is important to know whether the damage is manufacturing damage or pilot damage. This is possible only when you tell everything about the crash. Conveying the truth is important since every setting of the drone are automatically recorded. Thus
        you cannot make it look like a manufacturers damage falsely. The user must also know that they might be aware of certain manufacturer’s damage and may end up paying the price unknowingly. Before visiting the service center, you have to remove
        the SD card and pick them in the box correctly.</p>
    <h3 style="position: absolute;top: 281%;left: 4%;"><span>*Shipping fees</span></h3>
    <p style="position: absolute;top: 285%;left: 4%;font-size: 20px;line-height: 26px;">DJI and other drone manufacturers provide a shipping label that conveys the shipping number. It must be conveyed to the service center to able them track down the history of the drone and what period it was manufactured.</p>
    <h1 style="position: absolute;top: 305%;left: 4%;">1. How much should it cost to repair your drone and is it worth fixing</h1>
    <p style="position: absolute;top: 321%;left: 4%;font-size: 20px;line-height: 26px;">The repair cost obviously depends on the drone and how expensive are the parts. Here is a simple breakdown of cost of one of the leading drone parts; • Gimbal Camera $235.99 <br> • Flexible camera flat cable $19.99 <br> • Left motor arm $44-$49 <br>        • Gimbal vibration damping $12.99 <br> • Mounting bracket gimbal $19 <br> • Camera Co-axis cable -$21 <br> • Front left motor arm $39-$49 <br> <br>The service charges differ from $70-$98 per hour that makes it approx. $180 for two-hour work.
        <br> Some drones are worth fixing if they are covered under warranty as you have to pay only the amount that is left after covering the warranty. When you own a high-class manufactured drone, you do not have to worry much about the repairs and
        services. The manufacturers’ warranty usually covers them, and you have to pay only the balance amount. The manufacturer sends you an email quoting the total expenses incurred for repairs. In case the main part requires replacement, it may cost
        you hire but obviously not as much as the original cost of a drone. The user has to make all the payments in advance to avail all the repairs and replacement. The repair status is almost 4 weeks, and the user has to wait until it is shipped in
        good condition. Thus, finally, summarizing everything, drone repair is worth only when it is minimum and doesn’t cost you as much as the original drone price.
    </p>
    <h1 style="position: absolute;top: 436%;left: 4%;">2. Drone repair with warranty</h1>
    <p style="position: absolute;top: 446%;left: 4%;font-size: 20px;line-height: 26px;">Drones with warranty are possibly the low-cost repairs carried out for the user’s benefit. If you have bought a branded drone, it comes with a manufacturer’s warranty. If the drone is damaged due to a manufacturing defect, it is completely repaired
        as per the maker’s rules. However, sometimes the defect exceeds the limitation of the warranty which is repaired in exceptional cases. During this process, the manufacturer sends an email quoting the balance amount of repairs cost to the customer.
        Once the payment is cleared, manufacturers carry out the repair process and ship the drone back.
    </p>
    <h1 style="position: absolute;top: 494%;left: 4%;">3. How to check the status of drone</h1>
    <p style="position: absolute;top: 504%;left: 4%;font-size: 20px;line-height: 26px;">Once you receive the drone after repair works are complete, it is important to calibrate the drone. Make sure that, you must calibrate all things before flying it. Calibrate the compass, remote controller, IMU and gimbal before flying to avoid any
        further crash. Some care is a cumbersome and slow process that takes hell lot of time for drone repair. Thus if you are flying, you must reboot the system and avoid any further damage.</p>
