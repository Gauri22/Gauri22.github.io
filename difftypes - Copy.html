    <h1 style="top: 14%;left: 4%;position: absolute;text-decoration: underline;">Types of drones</h1>
    <h2 style="position: absolute;top: 21%;left: 4%;color: navy;">1.Multiroter:</h2>
     <p style="position: absolute;top: 26%;left: 4%;color: black;font-size: 23px;">*If you are looking to get a small camera in the air for a relatively short period of time, then a multirotor is the way to go. They give you much more control over positioning and framing the camera to get you that perfect aerial photo shot.</p>
    <p style="position: absolute;top: 36%;left: 4%;color: black;font-size: 23px;">*The financial barrier to entry in the multirotor market is low thanks to the advancement of cell phone technology that has allowed the <br> price of drone components to become ignorantly smaller and cheaper. Out of the four types of drones that are available, multirotors are <br> the easiest to manufacture, and the most economical to fly.</p>
     <p style="position: absolute;top: 50%;left: 4%;color: black;font-size: 23px;">*Multirotors can be further classified based on the number of rotors on the aerial platform. Tricopters have 3 rotors, quadcopters have 4 rotors, hexacopters have 6 rotors and octocopters have 8 rotors. Quadcopters are the most popular and widely used.</p>
    <p style="position: absolute;top: 60%;left: 4%;color: black;font-size: 23px;">*Multirotors do have their downsides. The major constraint is the limited flying time, reduced endurance, and speed. They are not suited <br> for long distance surveying applications, mapping, or inspection. The main issue here is that most of the energy, usually from a battery source, is used to maintain the drone in a stable flying position. Currently multi rotors are only capable of maximum flying times of <br> 20 to 30 minutes with a minimal payload.</p>

    <h2 style="position: absolute;top: 118%;left: 4%;color: navy;">2.Fixed wing:</h2>
    <p style="position: absolute;top: 123%;left: 4%;color: black; font-size: 23px;">*Fixed wing drones are one of the types of drones that use the same principle that airplanes use to generate lift using a wing instead of vertical thrust generating rotors. The vertical lift is generated as a consequence of the forward motion of the wing through the air, making this a more efficient way of generating vertical lift.<br><br> *Fixed wing drones are able to traverse long distances, map wider areas, and stay within close proximity over points of interest. Along with the greater thrust generating efficiency, fixed wing drones are able to use gasoline powered engines. Due to the energy density of this type of fuel, gas powered drones are able to stay in the air for over 15 hours. <br> <br> *The main drawback of fixed wing aircraft is their inability to loiter over one point of interest, which rules them out for taking aerial photos and videos. Launching and landing fixed wing drones can also be problematic. To get them in the air, you need a runway or a catapult. To recover the drone, you will need a runway, parachute, or net to recover them safely. Only very small drones are suitable for launching by hand, or belly landing in an open field. <br> <br> *Fixed wing drones are costlier to fly, and more difficult to learn how to fly. Multi rotors have become widespread because they are easier to acquire, and easier to learn how to fly. This is not the case for fixed wing drones. You will need to have a basic understanding of flight dynamics to take off, fly to the designated waypoints, and then land safely. <br> <br> *With a fixed wing, the image generation is not a simple task as pointing and shooting an image with the camera. You will have acquired hundreds of thousands of images during the flight that need to be stitched together to generate the final tiled image.</p>

    <h2 style="position: absolute;top: 242%;left: 4%;color: navy;">3.Singl roter helicoptor:</h2>
    <p style="position: absolute;top: 247%;left: 4%;color: black; font-size: 23px;">*A multi rotor uses a number of rotors to generate vertical, but a single rotor uses just one, along with a tail rotor to control the heading. Helicopters are very common in manned aviation, but are rarely used in the drone community. <br><br>*Single rotor helicopter drones generate thrust more efficiently over multi-rotors, and can be powered by a gasoline engine for longer flight times. A larger rotor spinning slowly generates thrust more efficiently. This is why long endurance quadcopters have a large propeller diameter. A single rotor helicopter with long blades is more like a rotating wing than a propeller. This results in the greater thrust generating efficiency. <br><br>*If the application requires hovering a large payload, such as a LIDAR scanner, or you need a combination of long endurance with forward flight, then a single rotor helicopter drone is perfect. <br><br>*There is the drawback of the increased complexity, cost, vibration, and danger of large spinning blades. Extra care needs to be taken to prevent any injury caused by the spinning rotor <br><br>*With regards to difficulty of flying, a single rotor helicopter is somewhere between a multi-rotor and a fixed wing aircraft. Hovering a helicopter drone over a given spot is relatively simple, and the forward flight skills can be learned as you go. But helicopter drones are not as stable while flying, and requires good skills to keep it in the air. They also require more mechanical maintenance due to their increased complexity.</p>

    <h2 style="position: absolute;top: 363%;left: 4%;color: navy;">4.Fixed wing hybride:</h2>
    <p style="position: absolute;top: 368%;left: 4%;color: black; font-size: 23px;">*A new category of hybrid drones that can take off and land vertically are being developed. These merge the benefits of fixed wing UAVs with the ability to hover. <br><br>*Some of these hybrid drone concepts are essentially fixed wing designs with a vertical lift motor. Other designs are tail sitting aircraft that point vertical for takeoff before pitching over to fly horizontally. Further designs feature the rotor or the entire wing with propellers can point upwards for takeoff, and horizontally for forward flight. <br><br>*Some of these design configurations were tried in the 1950s and 1960s for manned aircraft, but were deemed too complex and difficult to fly. Many of the test flight ended in disastrous results. The advancement of modern flight computers, and advanced sensors, the task of flying these types of drones can be taken on by the computer. <br><br>*Currently, there are only a handful of hybrid fixed wings available on the market. However, you can expect to see more of these types of designs as the technology gets advanced. One example of this type of design, is Amazonâ€™s Prime Air delivery drone.</p>
