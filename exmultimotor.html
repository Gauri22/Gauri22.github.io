    <p style="position: absolute;top: 54%;left: 4%;color: black;font-size: 23px;">international comapny designs - a series of German prototype electric multicopters with 16 rotors, the first electric multicopter in the world to achieve manned flight.[17][18] The large number of low-cost motors make it economical, quiet and provide
        redundancy with ability to maintain control with up to four failed motors. Worldâ€™s first manned flight with an electric multicopter. At the end of October 2011, Thomas Senkel of e-volo had completed a series of unmanned tests and was ready for
        the first manned flight on an airstrip in Karlsruhe, Germany. The flight lasted one minute and 30 seconds.
