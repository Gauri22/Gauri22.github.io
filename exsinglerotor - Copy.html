    <p style="position: absolute;top: 24%;left: 4%;color: black;font-size: 23px;">A monocopter or gyropter is a rotorcraft that uses a single rotating blade. The concept is <br> similar to the whirling helicopter seeds that fall from some trees. The name gyropter is <br> sometimes applied to monocopters in which the entire aircraft rotates about its center <br> of mass as it flies. The name "monocopter" has alsobeen applied to the personal jet <br> pack constructed by Andreas Petzoldt.

    <p style="position: absolute;top: 59%;left: 4%;color: black;font-size: 23px;">VTOL Fixed-Wing UAVs combine the benefits of multi-rotor platforms with fixed-wing <br> drones and transition between the two modes during flight. VTOL fixed-wing drones <br> are a versatile choice for a wide range of commercial and military aerial applications. <br> The ability to vertically take-off and land,  without the need for a launcher or runway, <br> means these drones can be operated in almost any location. The fixed-wing design <br> provides greater endurance, the ability to cover longer distances, and the option to fly <br> faster, allowing operators to fly for longer and cover more ground when compared to <br> a multi-rotor UAV. Here are just some applications for VTOL fixed-wing hybrid drones.
